SurfsUp Challenge
Overview
In this challenge we ran a climate analysis for precipitation and temperature in Honolulu, HI  while primarily focusing on two months, June and December. To create this, we used a SQLlite database, and used a SQL tool called SQLAlchemy  to connect and extract data from the database. After the data was extracted from database, using a query in python, it was placed into a dataframe for more analysis.

Results
•	Comparing both June and December, based on the charts below, it is demonstrated that the average temperature in June is 74.9 degrees.
